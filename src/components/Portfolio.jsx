                <p>â€‹By leveraging predictive analytics, I provided professional career 
                    counseling to an active rotating client list, assisting employees in 
                    navigating targeted career pathways and identifying career goals and 
                    timelines. Predictive analytics enabled the identification of patterns 
                    and trends that informed personalized career advice, leading to higher 
                    internal promotions and fostering an environment of internal equity and 
                    self-development. Additionally, predictive analytics allowed for 
                    collaboration with business leaders to streamline their talent pipeline 
                    by identifying employees with advancement readiness across the global 
                    enterprise. This strategic use of data not only optimized employee 
                    development but also enhanced organizational performance and decision-making.
